# Brain_Fck_Converter
An attempt to make a converter from text to BF.

I did close to 0 effort in making a clean code since Brain F*ck language is already really messy. 
Please don't look at the code itself and just focus on the output. It's far from being optimal but it depicts the way I would write things in bf:
By giving a convenient ascii code to the first few bits I would use then by going back and forth between them to write some not-so-much interesting things.

## This code is purely useless and if you find it any utility, I need to let you know that your goals are beyond my understanding.
